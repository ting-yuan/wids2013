01. web, I mean HTML5, which includes JavaScript, various APIs such as webgl.

    open, means that we don't have to suffer private/propritary specs

    no installation, seamless update

    although still in draft, they are supported by...
    the most promising platform to be portable.

05. the reason to show this trivial example is to compare with the compiled one.

07. simply explain what's memory model; it's part of the runtime.

08. how JavaScript emulates C/C++'s type;
    JavaScript has the notion of int, especially int32, although not explicitly.

09. go though it.

10. s2s in contrast of b2b/b2s

    especially expensive options:
    partial redundency elimnination, sparse conditional constant propagation
    removal of induction variables, linear function test replacement

    main reason that why weakly typed language is slow.

11. it's designed to be the target of compiler generated codes.
    simple, fast, does not use those higher but slower language features
